# Diabetes and Comorbidities Prediction using Machine Learning
This repository contains the full implementation of my M.Tech thesis project titled **"Machine Learning-Based Prediction Models for Diabetes and Related Comorbidities: An Integrated Approach"** submitted to MAKAUT in 2023.

This work integrates AI/ML to assist in early detection and predictive analysis of diabetes with associated health risks.

## üîç Abstract
Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a prevalent chronic disease that affects millions of individuals worldwide and is accompanied by a variety of complications. These complications can be accurately predicted to significantly improve patient care and inform treatment strategies. Using the DM-Registry, Khorramabad dataset, we propose a predictive model for diabetes complications in this study. The model analyzes patient data and predicts complications such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and cardiovascular disease (CDV) using machine learning techniques, specifically the Decision Tree and Voting classifier. Using the Streamlit framework, a user-friendly interface is created, allowing individuals to easily enter their medical information. The proposed model achieves high levels of  precision, accuracy, the F1 score and recall when predicting diabetes complications. Cross-validation guarantees the dependability and generalizability of the model's performance. The proposed model is preferable in terms of predictive accuracy and performance metrics, as demonstrated by a comparison with baseline models. These findings contribute to personalized diabetes management by facilitating early identification and intervention for individuals at risk for developing complications. The utility and efficacy of the proposed model make it a valuable resource for healthcare professionals and individuals seeking to understand their diabetes-related risks. However, future research must include additional validation and exploration of diverse populations and the incorporation of additional features. The proposed predictive model for diabetes complications has great potential for improving patient care, optimizing treatment strategies, and reducing the burden of complications related to diabetes.
